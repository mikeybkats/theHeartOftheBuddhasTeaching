# The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching
### Thich Nhat Han

### Chapter 1: Entering the heart of the Buddha

**Suffering** is the primary gateway to advancement. Buddha has said, "Because there is suffering in your heart, it is possible for you to enter my heart."

"Without suffering, you cannot grow. Without suffering, you cannot get the peace and joy you deserve. Please donâ€™t run away from your suffering. Embrace it and cherish it."

### Chapter 2: The first Dharma Talk

**Dharma** 

**Four Noble Truths:**
	- the existance of suffering
	- the making of suffering
	- the possibility of restoring well being
	- and the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to well being 

Identifying suffering, its causes and the path forward offers liberation to the followers of this philosophy.

**The teaching of the middle way** - Austerity is not the way. Avoiding our problems is not the way. Indulging in vice like sex, fame and drugs is also not the way. The middle way is the way to acknowledge these things
