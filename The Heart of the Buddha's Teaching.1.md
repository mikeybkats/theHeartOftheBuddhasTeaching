After recognizing that there is suffering, we need to think about why it's really there. What did you do to lead you to this place? What toxins from the world (television, media, news, ideas, food, alcohol, drugs) have you consumed?

Ending our suffering – *nirodha* – requires refraining from the things that make us suffer.means t

The Buddha taught us how to recognize and acknowledge the presence of suffering, but he also taught the cessation of suffering. If there were no possibility of cessation, what is the use of practicing? The Third Truth is that healing is possible.

#### Truth 4: The path that leads to refraining from the things that we do that make us suffer

*marga* - the Noble ightfold ath. The path of eight practices: 

	1.Right view
	2.Right thinking
	3.Right speech
	4.Right action
	5.Right livelihood
	6.Right diligence
	7.Right mindfulness
	8.Right concentration

What does it mean to practice in the right way? It means that there is a wrong way that should not be practiced. There are ways that we know are not correct:	
```
“straight,” or “upright,” not bent or crooked. Right Mindfulness, for example, means that there are ways of being mindful that are right, straight, and beneficial. Wrong mindfulness means that there are ways to practice that are wrong, crooked, and unbeneficial.

### Chapter 4: Understanding the Buddha's teachings
```
Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing. If we read or listen with an open mind and an open heart, the rain of the Dharma will penetrate the soil of our consciousness.
