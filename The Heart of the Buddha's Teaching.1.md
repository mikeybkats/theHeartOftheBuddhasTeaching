### Thich Nhat Han

### Chapter 1: Entering the heart of the Buddha

**Suffering** is the primary gateway to advancement. Buddha has said, "Because there is suffering in your heart, it is possible for you to enter my heart."

```
"Without suffering, you cannot grow. Without suffering, you cannot get the peace and joy you deserve. Please don’t run away from your suffering. Embrace it and cherish it."

### Chapter 2: The first Dharma Talk

**Dharma** - The way of understanding and love.

**Four Noble Truths:**
	- the existnce of suffering
	- the making of suffering
	- the possibility of restoring well being
	- and the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to well being 

Identifying suffering, it's causes and the path forward offers liberation to the followers of this philosophy.

**The teaching of the middle way** - Austerity is not the way. Pretending and abstaining from all vice is not the way. Avoiding our problems is not the way. Indulging in vice like sex, fame and drugs is also not the way. The middle way is the way to acknowledge these things and process them. P.6

*Recognizing suffering lets us transform it into mindfulness, compassion, Avoiding our problems is not the way. peace and liberation.* P.7

### Chapter 3: The Four Noble Truths

#### Truth 1: Suffering
*The first noble truth is Suffering (dukkha).* The Chinese character for this translates as "bitter". 

We have to recognize our suffering, acknowledge those feelings in order to process it and progress from it.

#### Truth 2: Creation of Suffering
*Samudaya* – The second noble truth is the origin, nature, creation and arising of suffering.
```
"After we touch our suffering, we need to look deeply into it to see how it came to be."

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 9). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition.   
```

After recognizing that there is suffering, we need to think about why it's really there. What did you do to lead you to this place? What toxins from the world (television, media, news, ideas, food, alcohol, drugs) have you consumed?

#### Truth 3:  Bringing the creation our suffering to an end
Ending our suffering – *nirodha* – requires refraining from the things that make us suffer.means t  

```
The Buddha taught us how to recognize and acknowledge the presence of suffering, but he also taught the cessation of suffering. If there were no possibility of cessation, what is the use of practicing? The Third Truth is that healing is possible.

#### Truth 4: The path that leads to refraining from the things that we do that make us suffer

*marga* - the Noble ightfold ath. The path of eight practices: 

	1.Right view
	2.Right thinking
	3.Right speech
	4.Right action
	5.Right livelihood
	6.Right diligence
	7.Right mindfulness
	8.Right concentration

What does it mean to practice in the right way? It means that there is a wrong way that should not be practiced. There are ways that we know are not correct:	
```
“straight,” or “upright,” not bent or crooked. Right Mindfulness, for example, means that there are ways of being mindful that are right, straight, and beneficial. Wrong mindfulness means that there are ways to practice that are wrong, crooked, and unbeneficial.

### Chapter 4: Understanding the Buddha's teachings

```
Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing. If we read or listen with an open mind and an open heart, the rain of the Dharma will penetrate the soil of our consciousness.

Reading and listening should not feel difficult. Do now "try hard" to read or listen, try to allow the information to flow into you.

Since the original Buddha's death. There have been three schools of Buddhism:

	- Source Buddhism: the teachings from Buddha during his lifetime
	- Many Schools Buddhism: different schools that have divided on how to interpret and extend the teachings of Buddha
	- Mahayana Buddhism:

Oddly, it was four hundred years before any of the Buddha's teachings were even thought to be written down. Before then his teachings were only passed orally. When finally the monks of Sri Lanka who wear the copper colored robes started to think about writing Buddha's discourses on palm leaves it took them another one hundred years to begin. And, during this time there was only one monk who had memorized all the discourses, and he was known to be very arrogant (not the best vehicle to transmit the teachings of the Great Buddha). P12-13

Many of the monks who knew the words of the teachings were not able to comprehend their full meanings. Often the lessons they took from these teachings were incorrect. There are cases where the lessons of Buddha became distorted. One story relates a discourse where Buddha describes himself buckling down and "gritting his teeth and holding his tongue against his palate" to get the better of his own mind. He was however not referring to how to practice, he was referring to his misguided years where he was still learning, and this practice is not intended doctrine. P13

By the time the discourses were written down in Pali in Sri Lanka there were eighteen or twenty schools that had interpreted the teachings in different ways – but importantly the lessons derived are the same. The variations exist, but the morals are the same. P15

The third school of Buddhism began in the third century B.C.E when some monks decided to divorce themselves from the rest of society. People from their communititi them
