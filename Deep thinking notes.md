### the three Dharma seals 
Impermanence, non-self, inter-being

Thoughts on self:
Many of our desires stem from the idea that we can amplify or prove our self. Self is the same for everyone though â€“ impermanent. Focusing on activities that enhance or reinforce your self will ultimately detract from activities that move you closer to your goals.
