## Dhyana
Meditation – stopping and deep thinking
First live mindfully.
Second stop, think reflect.

Prajña Paramita – crossing over to the other side through insight wisdom and non-discrimination.

Meditation will become truth when there is understanding and insight.

*Goals.* What is the present moment? 
The present moment is always clouded by the self. By relating information to our own self the past and present are clouded. You can never see the future in totality. With a good plan, remove the sense of self and focus on the present. Doing this will ensure an easier path to your goals.  

| Present moment | Sense of self | Actual future | Sense of future | Sense of past
| -- |--| -- | -- | -- |
| Where you are currently  | Your self conscious self | The future that you can never see in totality | What you think will happen | What you thought did happen |
												

### The practice of Dharma 
the way of understanding and love

### The three Dharma seals 
- Impermanence 
- non-self 
- inter-being
	- All things are related
	- Equanimity

Thoughts on self:
Many of our desires stem from the idea that we can amplify or prove our self. Self is the same for everyone though – impermanent. Focusing on activities that enhance or reinforce your self will ultimately detract from activities that move you closer to your goals.

### The three bodies
The body of bliss
The Dharma Body
The body of transformation

### the three doors
- Emptyness
- Signlessness
- Aimlessness

### The four immeasurable minds
- Compassion
- Love
- Joy
- Equanimity

### The five aggregates
1. Form
2. Feelings
3. Perceptions
4. Mental formations
5. Consciousness

Meditation is to be aware of each feeling. Recognize it, smile at it, look deeply into it, and embrace it with all your heart.

The aggregate of perception includes noting, naming, and conceptualizing as well as the perceiver and and perceived object.

When considering the five aggregates consider your goals, motivations and what your perceived notion of that goal is – what is the formation/result of that goal? Is that really what is going to happen?

"Our practice is to be aware of the manifestation and the presence of mental formations and look deeply into them in order to see their true nature." p180 The heart of the Buddha's teaching. Tich Nhat Han


### Five mindfulness trainings:
- Protecting life and the earth
- Prevent the exploitation of life by humans, plus being generous.
- Prevent sexual abuse 
- Practice deep listening
- Be mindful of what you consume

Practicing being aware of your mental formations. Many of our behaviors are motivated by inflating our sense of self. When we drink alcohol it inflates our ego and enhances our sense of self while at the same time diminishing our level of awareness and impairing judgement.

### True inclusiveness / transformation
True inclusiveness is having the capacity to be aware of those around you, take them in, embrace what they offer through deep listening and ultimately transform because of this. In other words inclusivity is not just inviting strangers to your table, but actually having the mindset to change based on your learning of them.

### Why does my mind want to water the bad seeds?
There are good seeds and bad seeds.

Upper consciousness (present mind):
Seeds of Affliction: Anger, Jealousy, ect 
Seeds of mindfulness: Caring, Joy, inclusiveness, ect 
Lower consciousness (store):

### Interdependent co-arising
"This is because that is. This is not because that is not. This comes to be because that comes to be. This ceases to exist because that ceases to exist."

Tich Nhat Han says that interdependent co-arising should not be relied on as a Bhuddist teaching, but it can be helpful in understanding some of the teachings. My takeaway is that while useful these ways of thinking can lead to wrong thinking and wrong path when considered by a deluded mind.

```
Obstacles teach us about ourselves. They teach us about our strengths and weaknesses, and help us understand our limits. They create forks in the road where you get to decide which way to go.
