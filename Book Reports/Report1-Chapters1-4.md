# Book Report: The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (chapters 1 - 4)

The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching is a book by Thich Nhat Han.  As the title suggests, Nhat Han writes about getting to the center of Buddhist teachings and philosophies. Buddhist Philosophy is not rooted in following a specific doctrine or a specific set of rules or commandments as is done in western religions like Christianity. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching is truly a mindset that can be applied to how living life is approached.

Buddhism is structured around Four Noble truths. This is how these corner stones are referred to – as Noble Truths – by practitioners of the Buddhist religion. They are noble because they lead to a path that will help its followers achieve a fuller understanding of the world. Before the path is explained, let's dive into what these Noble Truths are all about. 

The noble truths are at Buddhism's core and they help people process the hardships of their realities. This is why the first Noble truth is suffering. Suffering grounds all the noble truths.

The the second Noble Truth is understanding suffering. After a person is made to suffer, to progress beyond that suffering the sufferer must look closely to discover why they are suffering at all in the first place. After the root cause is realized it can be stopped. Ending the suffering is the third Noble Truth. One doctrine taught by many wise mothers and fathers is that the best medicine for not getting sick is to not get sick in the first place. This is the last Noble Truth: follow a set of rules to help you avoid the things that we know make us suffer. This is the path.

In Buddhism this path is known as the Noble Eightfold Path, and it manifests itself as a morally correct way to approach life. The path has eight philosophies for conduct of behavior – Right View, Right Thinking, Right speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Diligence, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. There are ways to do all of these things "wrong" and ways to do them "right." As Thich Nhat Han points out, much of this is about having an open mind. And, to quote him:

"Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing. If we read or listen with an open mind and an open heart, the rain of the Dharma will penetrate the soil of our consciousness.

Since the original Buddha's death. There have been three schools of Buddhism:

	- Source Buddhism: the teachings from Buddha during his lifetime
	- Many Schools Buddhism: different schools that have divided on how to interpret and extend the teachings of Buddha
	- Mahayana Buddhism: monks who divorced themselves from society to practice Buddhism.

The three streams of Buddhism compliment each other. And, each school looks into the old teachings and explores some of the forgotten or misunderstood lessons of the past. Buddha made of point of saying that his sutras were not direct insights in of themselves, but lessons to extract meaning from.
