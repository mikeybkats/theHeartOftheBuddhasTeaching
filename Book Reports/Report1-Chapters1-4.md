# Book Report: The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (chapters 1 - 4)

The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching is a book by Thich Nhat Han.  As the title suggests, Nhat Han writes about getting to the center of Buddhist teachings and philosophies. Buddhist Philosophy is not rooted in following a specific doctrine or a specific set of rules or commandments as is done in western religions like Christianity. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching is truly a mindset that can be applied to how living life is approached.
