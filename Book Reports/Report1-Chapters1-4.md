# Book Report: The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (chapters 1 - 4)

The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching is a book by Thich Nhat Han.  As the title suggests, Nhat Han writes about getting to the center of Buddhist teachings and philosophies. Buddhist Philosophy is not rooted in following a specific doctrine or a specific set of rules or commandments as is done in western religions like Christianity. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching is truly a mindset that can be applied to how living life is approached.

Buddhism is structured around Four Noble truths. This is how these corner stones are referred to – as Noble Truths – by practitioners of the Buddhist religion. They are noble because they lead to a path that will help its followers achieve a fuller understanding of the world. Before the path is explained, let's dive into what these Noble Truths are all about. 

The noble truths are at Buddhism's core and they help people process the hardships of their realities. This is why the first Noble truth is suffering. Suffering grounds all the noble truths.

The the second Noble Truth is understanding suffering. After a person is made to suffer, to progress beyond that suffering the sufferer must look closely to discover why they are suffering at all in the first place.

The third Noble Trut

This path is known as the Noble Eightfold Path, and it manifests itself as a morally correct way to approach life. The path has eight philosophies for conduct of behavior – Right View, Right Thinking, Right speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Diligence, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.
