It's clear that suffering is the reason why we meditate. We meditate for clarity and to help ourselves through our turmoil. That turmoil can be a cluttered mind, a stressful day, an overwhelming situation or any other number of things. The bottom line is that meditation brings practitioners closer some kind of resolution â€“some kind of truth.
