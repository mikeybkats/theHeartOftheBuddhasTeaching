It's clear that suffering is the reason why we meditate. We meditate for clarity and to help ourselves through our turmoil. That turmoil can be a cluttered mind, a stressful day, an overwhelming situation or any other number of things. The bottom line is that meditation brings practitioners closer some kind of resolution –some kind of truth. The mistake that some have made in the past is to dwell on the suffering itself. To treat suffering as though it is some kind of lesson. Suffering itself is not a lesson. The lessons come from suffering is processed and how to avoid the traps that cause suffering. Indeed, one of the primary points of meditation is to become aware of the causes of suffering. 

One of the pitfalls is to say that craving or desire is the reason why we suffer. It's not uncommon for some to fixate on a particular reason why they are suffering, because it is an obvious reason to them. We see this in popular culture sometimes

the root cause prevents realizing the second Noble truth – realizing where suffering is truly coming from. With practice it is possible to know very quickly why a negative feeling is felt.
