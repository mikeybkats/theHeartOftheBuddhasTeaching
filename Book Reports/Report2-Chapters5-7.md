It's clear that suffering is the reason why we meditate. We meditate for clarity and to help ourselves through our turmoil. That turmoil can be a cluttered mind, a stressful day, an overwhelming situation or any other number of things. The bottom line is that meditation brings practitioners closer some kind of resolution –some kind of truth. The mistake that some have made in the past is to dwell on the suffering itself. To treat suffering as though it is some kind of lesson. Suffering itself is not a lesson. The lessons come from suffering is processed and how to avoid the traps that cause suffering. Indeed, one of the primary points of meditation is to become aware of the causes of suffering. 

One of the pitfalls is to say that craving or desire is the reason why we suffer. It's not uncommon for some to fixate on a particular reason why they are suffering, because it is an obvious reason to them. We see this in political culture sometimes, when a particular group expresses the importance of a particular issue over all others, even though the issue does not have a large relevance to their own lives. When this happens the actual needs of the group are diminished by that centralized issue. 

To recap, there are four noble truths: 
**Four Noble Truths:**
	- the existence of suffering
	- the making of suffering
	- the possibility of restoring well being
	- and the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to well being 

In meditation focusing on the incorrect root cause of our suffering prevents realizing the second Noble truth – realizing where suffering is truly coming from. With time and practice it is possible to know very quickly why a negative feeling is felt. This is why it is so important not to jump to an emotional conclusion without thinking it through. As Thich Nhat Han says, "To succeed in the practice, we must stop trying to prove that everything is suffering. In fact, we must stop trying to prove anything." P23.
