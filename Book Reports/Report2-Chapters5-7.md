It's clear that suffering is the reason why we meditate. We meditate for clarity and to help ourselves through our turmoil. That turmoil can be a cluttered mind, a stressful day, an overwhelming situation or any other number of things. The bottom line is that meditation brings practitioners closer some kind of resolution –some kind of truth. The mistake that some have made in the past is to dwell on the suffering itself. To treat suffering as though it is some kind of lesson. Suffering itself is not a lesson. The lessons come from suffering is processed and how to avoid the traps that cause suffering. Indeed, one of the primary points of meditation is to become aware of the causes of suffering. 

One of the pitfalls is to say that craving or desire is the reason why we suffer. It's not uncommon for some to fixate on a particular reason why they are suffering, because it is an obvious reason to them. We see this in political culture sometimes, when a particular group expresses the importance of a particular issue over all others, even though the issue does not have a large relevance to their own lives. When this happens the actual needs of the group are diminished by that centralized issue. 

To recap, there are four noble truths: 
**Four Noble Truths:**
	- the existence of suffering
	- the making of suffering
	- the possibility of restoring well being
	- and the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to well being 

In meditation focusing on the incorrect root cause of our suffering prevents realizing the second Noble truth – realizing where suffering is truly coming from. With time and practice it is possible to know very quickly why a negative feeling is felt. This is why it is so important not to jump to an emotional conclusion without thinking it through. As Thich Nhat Han says, "To succeed in the practice, we must stop trying to prove that everything is suffering. In fact, we must stop trying to prove anything." P23.

There are two parts of meditation:
	- Looking deeply – *vipashyana* 
	- Stopping – *shamatha*

Looking deeply is often overemphasized. While stopping is often not as greatly stressed. But, the importance of stopping cannot be overemphasized, it is fundamental to meditation.

There is a story in Zen circles about a man and a horse. The horse is galloping quickly, and it appears that the man on the horse is going somewhere important. Another man, standing alongside the road, shouts, “Where are you going?” and the first man replies, “I don’t know! Ask the horse!”

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 24). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

It's a cute story – of course many times we are the man on the horse and our subconscious is the horse carrying us away. 

The horse is "habit energy that pulls us along, and we are powerless." P24

The power of our habit energies are naturally more powerful than our strength of will. How many times have you been at the computer trying "so hard" to re-engage with work, but instead you end up reading a wikipedia article or shopping online. It takes practice and time to develop new habits to counteract these natural habit tendencies. The first step is simply to stop. This is mindfulness – it's becoming aware of the river of your subconscious and not allowing it to be your master.
