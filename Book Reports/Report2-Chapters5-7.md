To recap, there are four noble truths in Buddhism: 
**Four Noble Truths:**
	- the existence of suffering
	- the making of suffering
	- the possibility of restoring well being
	- and the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to well being

It's clear that suffering is the reason why we meditate. We meditate for clarity and to help ourselves through our turmoil. That turmoil can be a cluttered mind, a stressful day, an overwhelming situation or any other number of things. The bottom line is that meditation brings practitioners closer to some kind of resolution –some kind of truth. The mistake that some have made in the past is to dwell on the suffering itself. To treat suffering as though it is some kind of lesson. Suffering itself is not a lesson. The lessons come from how suffering is processed and how to avoid the traps that cause suffering. Indeed, one of the primary points of meditation is to become aware of the causes of suffering. 

One of the pitfalls is to jump to a conclusion about why there is suffering, or it may be more apt to say that we sometimes have a preconceived notion of why we suffer. We see this in political culture sometimes, when a particular group expresses the importance of a particular issue over all others, even though the issue does not have a large relevance to their own lives. When this happens the actual needs of the group are diminished by that centralized issue. 

In meditation focusing on the incorrect root cause of our suffering prevents realizing the second Noble truth – realizing where suffering is truly coming from. With time and practice it is possible to know very quickly why a negative feeling is felt. This is why it is so important not to jump to an emotional conclusion without thinking it through. As Thich Nhat Han says, "To succeed in the practice, we must stop trying to prove that everything is suffering. In fact, we must stop trying to prove anything." P23.

Meditation is not something to do for a specific gain. It's a technique that can be employed at any time to help gain clarity in your mind. It can be done while you're walking. Sitting. Standing. I have personally found that simply being conscious of your breath can deepen focus during a conversation.

There are two parts of meditation:
	- Looking deeply – *vipashyana* 
	- Stopping – *shamatha*

Looking deeply is often overemphasized. While stopping is often not as greatly stressed. But, the importance of stopping cannot be overemphasized, it is fundamental to meditation.

There is a story in Zen circles about a man and a horse. The horse is galloping quickly, and it appears that the man on the horse is going somewhere important. Another man, standing alongside the road, shouts, “Where are you going?” and the first man replies, “I don’t know! Ask the horse!”

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 24). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

It's a cute story – of course many times we are the man on the horse and our subconscious is the horse carrying us away. 

The horse is "habit energy that pulls us along, and we are powerless." P24

The power of our habit energies are naturally more powerful than our strength of will. How many times have you been at the computer trying "so hard" to re-engage with work, but instead you end up reading a wikipedia article or shopping online. It takes practice and time to develop new habits to counteract these natural habit tendencies. Allowing our thoughts to drift can ultimately cause our behaviors to drift as well. The first step is simply to stop –this is often not easy. But, it's the first step to being mindful. Mindfulness is becoming aware of the river of your subconscious and not allowing it to be your master.  

Not being aware of this river is a bad problem. Drifting thoughts lead to forgetfulness, which is the opposite of mindfulness. I think of forgetfulness as a way of neglecting our own realities. We forget to appreciate the world around us, we forget to realize the people we love, we forget we are enjoying a cup of coffee or a cold beer with a friend. This is why it's so important to stop. If you can take the step of stopping, then you can become aware. This is the first function of meditation.

The second function of meditation is calming. Meditation relieves stress. There are five stages of calming the body:

- Recognition - knowing there is a feeling, naming it
- Acceptance - knowing the feeling is true, knowing it really exists
- Embracing - holding the feeling and being truly okay with it
- Looking deeply - try to understand why it was caused
- Insight - understanding the many causes the bigger picture and solutions

After calming ourselves, the next purpose of meditation is rest. Rest is required for growth and healing. Meditation should not feel hard, let the body sink into it and relax. If there is a struggle, let it go. 

If I've learned anything about meditating it's that meditation is about letting go. Oddly, it's about letting go of control to be more into control. Or, Letting go of resistance to be more resistive to something. If I can identify a pain and learn about the root cause I can heal that pain and prevent that pain and ultimately understand that pain.  

There is a metaphor for how Buddhism is practiced. It's called The wheel of Dharma and it is "turned" three times for each Noble Truth. Bare with me, there is some overlap with some of the things we've already talked about. On each turn a new stage of understanding is reached:

First turning – Recognition
Second turning – Encouragement
Third turning – Realization

The purpose of the first turning is to recognize that there is suffering and to identify what that suffering is, how it has originated. In many cases, something feels wrong, but the cause and feelings are vague. Is it physical, mental? or physiological?

At the second turning the practitioner takes the time to look into their suffering to understand its nature. It may take minutes, an hour, days or weeks to understand the suffering (it could take longer too). Part of progressing and understanding suffering is to not forget it, to revisit it. 

To process this information requires that the practicer seeks out guidance and support from their friends, loved ones and teacher(s). The practicer must make every effort to find the roots of their suffering.
