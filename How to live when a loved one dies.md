Oneness

_The moment I die,  _
_I will try to come back to you_
_as quickly as possible._
_I promise it will not take long,_
_Isn't it true_
_I am already with you,_
_as I die each moment?_
_I come back to you_
_in every moment._
_Just look,_
_feel my presence,_
_If you want to cry,_
_please cry._
_And know_
_that I will cry with you._
_The tears you shed will heal us both._
_Your tears are mine_

#### page 37 - When we are overwhelmed by grief
