Oneness

_The moment I die,  _
_I will try to come back to you_
_as quickly as possible._
_I promise it will not take long,_
_Isn't it true_
_I am already with you,_
_as I die each moment?_
_I come back to you_

_that I will cry with you._
_The tears you shed will heal us both._
_Your tears are mine_

Likewise, if you are angry with your children, you are angry with yourself. Our children are our continuation, and they carry us into the future."

#### page 54 - Healing the past in the present

"The past is not truly gone; it is still here, and we can touch it. We may have regrets about the past and believe we cannot go back to fix our mistakes. In fact, touching the present moment, we can still touch the pain and the wounds of the past."

#### page 59 - Self-Care listening to a mindfulness bell

"The sound of the bell is our friend, reminding us to stop what we are doing and come home to ourselves and the present moment."
