### Thich Nhat Han

### Chapter 1: Entering the heart of the Buddha

**Suffering** is the primary gateway to advancement. Buddha has said, "Because there is suffering in your heart, it is possible for you to enter my heart."

"Without suffering, you cannot grow. Without suffering, you cannot get the peace and joy you deserve. Please donâ€™t run away from your suffering. Embrace it and cherish it."
