# The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching
### Thich Nhat Han

### Chapter 1: Entering the heart of the Buddha

**Suffering** is the primary gateway to advancement. Buddha has said, "Because there is suffering in your heart, it is possible for you to enter my heart."

```
"Without suffering, you cannot grow. Without suffering, you cannot get the peace and joy you deserve. Please don’t run away from your suffering. Embrace it and cherish it."

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 5). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

### Chapter 2: The first Dharma Talk

**Dharma** - The way of understanding and love.

**Four Noble Truths:**
	- the existnce of suffering
	- the making of suffering
	- the possibility of restoring well being
	- and the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to well being 

Identifying suffering, it's causes and the path forward offers liberation to the followers of this philosophy.

**The teaching of the middle way** - Austerity is not the way. Pretending and abstaining from all vice is not the way. Avoiding our problems is not the way. Indulging in vice like sex, fame and drugs is also not the way. The middle way is the way to acknowledge these things and process them. P.6

*Recognizing suffering lets us transform it into mindfulness, compassion, Avoiding our problems is not the way. peace and liberation.* P.7

### Chapter 3: The Four Noble Truths

#### Truth 1: Suffering
*The first noble truth is Suffering (dukkha).* The Chinese character for this translates as "bitter". 

We have to recognize our suffering, acknowledge those feelings in order to process it and progress from it.

#### Truth 2: Creation of Suffering
*Samudaya* – The second noble truth is the origin, nature, creation and arising of suffering.
```
"After we touch our suffering, we need to look deeply into it to see how it came to be."

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 9). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition.   
```

After recognizing that there is suffering, we need to think about why it's really there. What did you do to lead you to this place? What toxins from the world (television, media, news, ideas, food, alcohol, drugs) have you consumed?

#### Truth 3:  Bringing the creation our suffering to an end
Ending our suffering – *nirodha* – requires refraining from the things that make us suffer.means t  

```
The Buddha taught us how to recognize and acknowledge the presence of suffering, but he also taught the cessation of suffering. If there were no possibility of cessation, what is the use of practicing? The Third Truth is that healing is possible.

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 11). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

#### Truth 4: The path that leads to refraining from the things that we do that make us suffer

*marga* - the Noble eightfold path. The path of eight practices: 

	1.Right view
	2.Right thinking
	3.Right speech
	4.Right action
	5.Right livelihood
	6.Right diligence
	7.Right mindfulness
	8.Right concentration

What does it mean to practice in the right way? It means that there is a wrong way that should not be practiced. There are ways that we know are not correct:	
```
“straight,” or “upright,” not bent or crooked. Right Mindfulness, for example, means that there are ways of being mindful that are right, straight, and beneficial. Wrong mindfulness means that there are ways to practice that are wrong, crooked, and unbeneficial.

### Chapter 4: Understanding the Buddha's teachings

```
Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing. If we read or listen with an open mind and an open heart, the rain of the Dharma will penetrate the soil of our consciousness.

Reading and listening should not feel difficult. Do now "try hard" to read or listen, try to allow the information to flow into you.

Since the original Buddha's death. There have been three schools of Buddhism:

	- Source Buddhism: the teachings from Buddha during his lifetime
	- Many Schools Buddhism: different schools that have divided on how to interpret and extend the teachings of Buddha
	- Mahayana Buddhism: monks who divorced themselves from society to practice Buddhism.

Oddly, it was four hundred years before any of the Buddha's teachings were even thought to be written down. Before then his teachings were only passed orally. When finally the monks of Sri Lanka who wear the copper colored robes started to think about writing Buddha's discourses on palm leaves it took them another one hundred years to begin. And, during this time there was only one monk who had memorized all the discourses, and he was known to be very arrogant (not the best vehicle to transmit the teachings of the Great Buddha). P12-13

Many of the monks who knew the words of the teachings were not able to comprehend their full meanings. Often the lessons they took from these teachings were incorrect. There are cases where the lessons of Buddha became distorted. One story relates a discourse where Buddha describes himself buckling down and "gritting his teeth and holding his tongue against his palate" to get the better of his own mind. He was however not referring to how to practice, he was referring to his misguided years where he was still learning, and this practice is not intended doctrine. P13

By the time the discourses were written down in Pali in Sri Lanka there were eighteen or twenty schools that had interpreted the teachings in different ways – but importantly the lessons derived are the same. The variations exist, but the morals are the same. P15

The third school, – Mahayana – of Buddhism, began in the third century B.C.E when some monks decided to divorce themselves from the rest of society. People from their lay Buddhist communities (those who identified as Buddhist but were not monks)communities helped to support them. And, although the Mahayanay lived a life away from society the they had the effect of inspiring the laypeople (and themselves) to develop reviving the contact of Buddhism in regular life. P16

 The three streams of Buddhism compliment each other. And, each school looks into the old teachings and explores some of the forgotten or misunderstood lessons of the past. Buddha made of point of saying that his sutras were not direct insights in of themselves, but lessons to extract meaning from. P17

```
“My teaching is like a finger pointing to the moon. Do not mistake the finger for the moon.”

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 17). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

One of the most important lessons of Buddhism is in fact not to be overly focused on the words. In fact, it was the Buddha who said to his disciples, "For forty five years, I have not uttered a single word." His meaning was that the words themselves should not present an iron clad theory for living, only a lens for understanding. A way to unwrap the complexities and noise around us. P18

```
Buddhist teachings are meant to awaken our true self, not merely to add to our storehouse of knowledge.

### Chapter 5: Is everything suffering?

It's commonly heard that people invoke the name of Buddha mechanically believing that this in some way offers some kind of insight. P19 

This wrote repetition is practice without intelligence. P19 

Repeating phrases of the sutra can be helpful but only so far, and it may – it will likely – **not lead** to resolving the conflict and suffering inside of you. P19

Suffering has been in the past treated as a lesson in of itself by some Buddhist practitioners. 

A theory known as the Three Kinds of Suffering has been an attempt to elevate the importance of suffering in the Buddhist faith. In this belief suffering is grouped with "Three Dharma Seals." This places it along side the concepts of *impermanence* and *non-self*. This is not correct. Suffering is a cause or result – usually of attachment to something else. Impermanence and non-self are qualities that help us not get caught up in signs and signifiers. P20-21

Another misunderstanding is that suffering is simply caused by craving. Buddha has said that suffering is caused by craving, but he also said that suffering is caused by other things too. P21 "anger, ignorance, suspicion, arrogance, and wrong views can also cause pain and suffering", P21

One of the primary points of meditation and practice is to become aware of the causes of suffering. It is too simplistic to simply say that a negative emotion is felt because of craving. More so doing this, blocks the individual from discovering the actual reason they are feeling that way. So, saying that craving is the root cause prevents realizing the second Noble truth – realizing where suffering is truly coming from. With practice it is possible to know very quickly why a negative feeling is felt.

```
To succeed in the practice, we must stop trying to prove that everything is suffering. In fact, we must stop trying to prove anything.

### Chapter 6: Stopping, Calming, Resting, Healing
```
There is a story in Zen circles about a man and a horse. The horse is galloping quickly, and it appears that the man on the horse is going somewhere important. Another man, standing alongside the road, shouts, “Where are you going?” and the first man replies, “I don’t know! Ask the horse!”

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 24). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

There are two parts of meditation:
	- Looking deeply – *vipashyana* 
	- Stopping – *shamatha*

Looking deeply is often overemphasized. While stopping is often not as greatly stressed. But, the importance of stopping cannot be overemphasized, it is fundamental to meditation.

```

It's a cute story – of course many times we are the man on the horse and our subconscious is the horse carrying us away. 

The horse is "habit energy that pulls us along, and we are powerless." P24

The power of our habit energies are naturally more powerful than our strength of will. How many times have you been at the computer trying "so hard" to re-engage with work, but instead you end up reading a wikipedia article or shopping online. It takes practice and time to develop new habits to counteract these natural habit tendencies. The first step is simply to stop. This is mindfulness – it's becoming aware of the river of your subconscious and not allowing it to be your master.

```
Mindfulness is the energy that allows us to recognize our habit energy and prevent it from dominating us.

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 25). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

Forgetfulness is the opposite of mindfulness. I think of forgetfulness as a way of neglecting our own realities. We forget to appreciate the world around us, we forget to realize the people we love, we forget we are enjoying a cup of coffee or a cold beer with a friend. And, (painfully) to quote Thich Nhat Han, "We sit with the person we love, but we don’t know that she is there. P25" It truly sounds like a nightmare, but many times this is a true reality. If forgetfulness is anything concrete, we can say that it is a trap that ensnares and prevents its captives from realizing that they are no longer living. 

This is why it's so important to stop. If you can take the step of stopping, then you can become aware. This is the first function of meditation.

The second function of meditation is calming. Meditation relieves stress. There are five stages of calming the body:

- Recognition - knowing there is a feeling, naming it
- Acceptance - knowing the feeling is true, knowing it really exists
- Embracing - holding the feeling and being truly okay with it
- Looking deeply - try to understand why it was caused
- Insight - understanding the many causes the bigger picture and solutions

After calming ourselves, the next purpose of meditation is rest. Rest is required for growth and healing. Meditation should not feel hard, let the body sink into it and relax. If there is a struggle, let it go. 

```
“My Dharma is the practice of nonpractice.”1 Practice in a way that does not tire you out, but gives your body, emotions, and consciousness a chance to rest.

Hanh, Thich Nhat. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching (p. 27). Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale. Kindle Edition. 
```

### Chapter 7: Touching our suffering 
*The wheel of Dharma* - The metaphor for how Buddhism is practiced. The wheel is "turned" three times for each Noble Truth.

First turning – Recognition
Second turning – Encouragement
Third turning – Realization

The purpose of the first turning is to recognize that there is suffering and to identify what that suffering is, how it has originated. In many cases, something feels wrong, but the cause and feelings are vague. Is it physical, mental? or physiological? To recognize, is like the work of a doctor when the doctor probes and presses on their patient and asks them, "If I press here does it hurt?" We show the doctor our problem, and this confirms that we have a problem because we are mentioning it.

When the practicer is at the second turning they take the time to look into their suffering to understand its nature. It may take minutes, an hour, days or weeks to understand the suffering (it could take longer too). Part of progressing and understanding suffering is to not forget it, to revisit it. Practicing takes time.
